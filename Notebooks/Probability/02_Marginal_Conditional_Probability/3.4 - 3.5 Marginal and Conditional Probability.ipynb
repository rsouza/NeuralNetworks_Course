To answer this kind of questions we need to take into account multiple events.\n",

For details on the notation, you can also refer to the previous article. You may also encounter the intersection notation: $\\cap$. For instance $P(\\text{x} \\cap \\text{y})$ corresponds to the probability that both $\\text{x}$ and $\\text{y}$ occur.\n",

For instance if the random variable $\\text{x}$ corresponds to throwing a dice, we know that $x$ can takes the values 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.

    "Let's try to understand what is really represented on these plots. I used the function `distplot` from the package seaborn. The y-axis gives the **probability density** that the variable takes the value given by the x-axis. You can find more details on probability density functions in [the last post](https://hadrienj.github.io/posts/Probability-Mass-and-Density-Functions/)/[notebook](https://github.com/hadrienj/deepLearningBook-Notes/tree/master/3.1-3.3%20Probability%20Mass%20and%20Density%20Functions). In short, the area under the curve has to be calculated for a certain range of the x axis to get the probability to get a value into that range. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what about the marginal probabilities? If we want to get the marginal probability of $\\text{x}$, we need to get the **area under the curve** of the probability density function along the y-axis. You can imagine that we look the 3D plot only from the y-axis (or a projection on this axis) and get the area under the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For discrete variables $\\text{x}$ and $\\text{y}$, we have seen that marginal probability $P(\\text{x})$ is the sum of the probabilities for each value of $\\text{y}$. Now that our variables are continuous, we have to use **integrals** but the principle is the same:\n",
    "\n",
    "- To calculate the marginal probability $P(\\text{x})$, we calculate the area under the curve of the projection of the variable on the x-axis.\n",
    "- To calculate the marginal probability $P(\\text{y})$, we calculate the area under the curve of the projection of the variable on the y-axis.\n",

    "<em>Probability density functions of two gaussian variables - <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_distribution\">source</a></em>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is used to recover the probability distribution of one variable when we know the joint probability distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "This can be expressed with the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p(x) = \\int p(x, y)dy\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",

The variable following the small $d$ at the end of the equation tells the variable used for the integration. So in the first equation, we integrate over $\\text{y}$. This means that we consider $\\text{x}$ as a constant. We do the opposite in the second equation.\n"

    "# 3.5 Conditional Probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional probability refers to the probability of an event given that another event occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependent and independent events\n",
    "\n",
    "First, it is important to distinguish between dependent and independent events! The intuition is a bit different in both cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of independent events: dice and coin\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we do an experiment where we throw a dice and toss a coin. We'll call two random variables describing these events with $\\text{x}$ corresponding to the dice throw and $\\text{y}$ corresponding to the coin toss.\n",
    "\n",
    "A question we can ask is: what is the probability to get a 3 from the dice throw and a 'head' from the coin toss?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the two events are independent because we don't expect any effect of one on the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example of dependent events: two cards from a deck\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll get two cards in a deck without replacement. The probabilities are different when we take the first card (all 52 cards are in the deck) and when we take the second card (there is now 51 cards, one missing). This means that the events are dependent: the result from the first draw will impact the probabilities of the second draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "A question we can ask is: what is the probability to draw a 6 on the second draw when we got a 6 on the first draw?\n",
    "\n",

    "Let's introduce some new notation: $P(\\text{y}=y | \\text{x}=x)$ describes the **conditional probability**: it is the probability that the random variable $\\text{y}$ takes the specific value $y$ **given that** the random variable $\\text{x}$ took the specific value $x$. It is different from $P(\\text{y}=y, \\text{x}=x)$ which corresponds to the probability of getting both the outcome $y$ for the random variable $\\text{y}$ and $x$ for the random variable $\\text{x}$. In the case of conditional probability, the event associated with the random variable $\\text{x}$ has already produced its outcome ($x$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, there is a convenient relationship between conditional probabilities and joint probability:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(\\text{y}=y | \\text{x}=x) = \\frac{P(\\text{y}=y, \\text{x}=x)}{P(\\text{x}=x)}\n",

    "Let's be verbose and convert the equation in plain English:\n",
    "\n",
    "The probability that the random variable $\\text{y}$ takes the value $y$ given that the random variable $\\text{x}$ took the value $x$ is the ratio of the probability that both events occur ($\\text{y}$ takes the value $y$ and $\\text{x}$ takes the value $x$) and the probability that $\\text{x}$ takes the value $x$.\n",

Clear?\n",

    "This last explanation leads to a question. We used probability multiplication ($P(\\text{x}=x)$ multiplied with $P(\\text{y}=y | \\text{x}=x)$) to represent the probability that multiple events occur ($P(\\text{y}=y, \\text{x}=x)$). Let's see why this makes sense.\n",

    "\n",
    "To understand why probability multiplication has to be used we need to understand what is the probability of each event. Let's focus on the first event, the first coin tossing. The probability $\\frac{1}{2}$: the 1 corresponds to the number of \"success\" outcomes (i.e. get a 'head'). The denominator (2) corresponds to the total number of possibilities. The possible outcomes are 'heads' or 'tails', so there are two outcomes. This leads to our probability $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if we consider the two events, here are all the possibles outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 'heads' and 'heads'\n",
    "- 'heads' and 'tails'\n",
    "- 'tails' and 'heads'\n",
    "- 'tails' and 'tails'\n",
    "\n",
    "We have still 1 success outcome ('heads' and 'heads') and there are 4 possible outcomes. The probability to get 'heads' and 'heads' is thus $\\frac{1}{4}$.\n",

    "The trick is here. To get the total number of possible outcomes, we just have to multiply the number of outcomes of each event. In this case $2 \\times 2$. If we multiply the event probabilities we have: $\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{4}$.\n",

    "First, let's recap all the mathematical notation we need. $P(\\text{x}=x)$ is the probability that the variable $\\text{x}$ takes the state $x$. For instance, $P(\\text{x}=3)$ corresponds to the probability of rolling a 3 on a dice. In a similar way, $P(\\text{y}=y)$ is the probability that the random variable $\\text{y}$ take the value $y$. For instance, $P(\\text{y}='heads')$ corresponds to the probability of getting a 'head'.\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that $P(\\text{y}='heads' | \\text{x}=3) = P(\\text{y}='heads')$ because these events are independent. This means that the probability of $\\text{x}$ is the same for any outcome of $\\text{y}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "  + Predict fewer than 1,000 characters as output for a given seed.\n",
    "  + Remove all punctuation from the source text, and therefore from the models’ vocabulary.\n",
    "  + Try a one hot encoded for the input sequences.\n",
    "  + Train the model on padded sentences rather than random sequences of characters.\n",
    "  + Increase the number of training epochs to 100 or many hundreds.\n",
    "  + Add dropout to the visible input layer and consider tuning the dropout percentage.\n",
    "  + Tune the batch size, try a batch size of 1 as a (very slow) baseline and larger sizes from there.\n",
    "  + Add more memory units to the layers and/or more layers.\n",
    "  + Experiment with scale factors (temperature) when interpreting the prediction probabilities.\n",
    "  + Change the LSTM layers to be “stateful” to maintain state across batches.\n"
